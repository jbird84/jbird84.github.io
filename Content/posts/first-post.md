# To use green screen in iMovie, first start with an empty project and select the background you would like to use. You can drag in your own background or select the background tab and choose one iMovie provides for free. 

<br />

<br />

## I Selected the underwater background and pulled it down to my project.

<br />

## Next I added a picture of me with a Green Sceen background.

<br />

## I select the image of me that I just added and click the dropdown next to *"Cut away"*

<br />

<br />

## Once I select *Green/Blue Screen* most of the work is done as you can see in the image below. However, you can select the one of the two clean-up tools to further remove any green screen flaws from your image. Lastly, you can use the slider next to "Softness" setting and this will further clean up your image. 

<br />

<br />

## Now you can select *file* at the top of the screen, then go down to _share_ and select *image* or *file*.  Follow the steps and save it where you can easily acces it.
